🤝 SignBridge AI

Unified Sign Language Translation Platform

Breaking communication barriers by translating sign language into text and speech using AI — in real time and from videos or images.

🚀 Overview

SignBridge AI is an AI-powered platform that translates sign language gestures into readable captions and audible speech.
It supports live camera input, uploaded videos, and images, all within a single unified web interface.

This project aims to improve accessibility for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by enabling seamless communication with the hearing world.

🎯 Key Features

✅ Live Camera Sign Translation
✅ Video Upload → Captions + Voice Output
✅ Image Upload → Gesture Recognition
✅ Real-time captions
✅ Text-to-Speech (TTS)
✅ Modular & Scalable Architecture
✅ Web-based (No installation required)

🧠 How It Works (High Level)

User selects an input mode:

Live Camera

Video Upload

Image Upload

Media is processed frame-by-frame using OpenCV

Hand landmarks are extracted using MediaPipe

Gestures are classified using trained ML logic

Output is generated as:

Text captions

Optional voice output (TTS)

Everything runs inside a Streamlit-powered web app
